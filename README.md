### How to build

System requirements to build Karabiner-Elements:

-   macOS 10.15+
-   Xcode 11+
-   Command Line Tools for Xcode
-   CMake (`brew install cmake`)

#### Steps

1.  Get source code by executing a following command in Terminal.app.

    ```shell
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements.git
    cd Karabiner-Elements
    git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1
    ```

2.  Find your codesign identity if you have one.<br />
    (Skip this step if you don't have your codesign identity.)

    ```shell
    security find-identity -p codesigning -v | grep 'Developer ID Application'
    ```

    The result is as follows.

    ```text
    1) 8D660191481C98F5C56630847A6C39D95C166F22 "Developer ID Application: Fumihiko Takayama (G43BCU2T37)"
    ```

    Your codesign identity is `8D660191481C98F5C56630847A6C39D95C166F22` in the above case.

3.  Set environment variable to use your codesign identity.<br />
    (Skip this step if you don't have your codesign identity.)

    ```shell
    export PQRS_ORG_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=8D660191481C98F5C56630847A6C39D95C166F22
    ```

4.  Find your codesign identity for installer signing if you have one.<br />
    (Skip this step if you don't have your codesign identity.)

    ```shell
    security find-identity -p basic -v | grep 'Developer ID Installer'
    ```

    The result is as follows.

    ```text
    1) C86BB5F7830071C7B0B07D168A9A9375CC2D02C5 "Developer ID Installer: Fumihiko Takayama (G43BCU2T37)"
    ```

    Your codesign identity is `C86BB5F7830071C7B0B07D168A9A9375CC2D02C5` in the above case.

5.  Set environment variable to use your codesign identity for installer signing.<br />
    (Skip this step if you don't have your codesign identity.)

    ```shell
    export PQRS_ORG_INSTALLER_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=C86BB5F7830071C7B0B07D168A9A9375CC2D02C5
    ```

6.  Build a package by executing a following command in Terminal.app.

    ```shell
    make package
    ```

    The `make` script will create a redistributable **Karabiner-Elements-VERSION.dmg** in the current directory.

#### Note: About pre-built binaries in the source tree

Karabiner-Elements uses some pre-built binaries in the source tree.

-   `src/vendor/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice/dist/*.kext`
-   `src/vendor/Sparkle/Sparkle.framework`

Above `make package` command does not rebuild these binaries.<br/>
(These binaries will be copied in the distributed package.)

If you want to rebuild these binaries, you have to build them manually.<br/>
Please follow the instruction of these projects.

##### About rebuilding kext in Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice

If you want to build kext in Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice, macOS requires a valid certificate which be able to sign the built kext.<br/>
Unless such certificate, macOS refuses to load the built kext.<br/>
Please read a documentation about [System Integrity Protection Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/KernelExtensions/KernelExtensions.html) for more details.

(We are including the pre-built kext binary to avoid the restriction that macOS requires a uncommon certificate.)
